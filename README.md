# WEB APP AUDIO SLOWDOWNER

This project is a web app that allows you to slow down, change the pitch and create loops of audio files. This is useful for musicians who want to learn a song by ear. It uses Tone.js to manipulate the audio and React to create the UI. I am currently working on adding a backend to allow users to save their audio files.
